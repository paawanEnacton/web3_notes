Ethereum account

- Consists address
- It can send transactions
- Whenever we want to make a transaction, we send ethers on someone's ADDRESS


2 types of accounts:
    i. Externally Owned Account (controlled by individuals)
    ii. Contract Account (controlled by smart contracts)

=> EOA (Externally Owned Account):
    - free to create
    - they can initiate network transactions
    - consists private and public keys
    

=> CA (Contract Account):
    - they require ether to create (becuase of network storage is being used by creating CA)
    - cannot initiate network transactions by their own
    - need to be triggered by user within EOA
